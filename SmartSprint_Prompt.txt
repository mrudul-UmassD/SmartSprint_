# SmartSprint Project Regeneration Prompt

Build a full-stack project management application called SmartSprint with the following features:

## Core Requirements
1. Authentication system with different user roles (Admin, Project Manager, Developer, Tester)
2. Default admin user (username/email: "admin", password: "admin")
3. Project management with CRUD operations
4. Task management within projects
5. User management with role-based permissions
6. Performance tracking and analytics

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Frontend: React with Material-UI
- Database: SQLite with proper models and initialization
- Authentication: JWT-based with proper middleware

## Key Features
1. Admin can create all types of users
2. Project managers can create users with lower ranks
3. Users can edit their passwords after logging in
4. Login supports both username and email
5. Performance tracking for tasks and projects
6. Comments and collaboration features

## Project Structure
- Backend: Express server with proper route organization
- Frontend: React components with context for state management
- Database: SQLite initialization with default admin user
- Testing: Jest tests for both frontend and backend

## Special Instructions
1. Implement a default admin user (username/email: "admin", password: "admin")
2. Allow login with either username or email
3. Implement proper role-based authorization for user creation
4. Create comprehensive database models with proper relationships

## Recent Fixes
1. Removed express-validator dependency and implemented manual validation
2. Enhanced findByUsername method in User model to properly distinguish between email and username
3. Added route for changing user password
4. Updated Login component to show default admin credentials
5. Updated AuthContext to handle login with either username or email
6. Added password update functionality for users

## Installation Instructions
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
4. Create `.env` file with JWT_SECRET
5. Run `npm start` to start both frontend and backend

Please provide a complete implementation with all necessary files and code to run this application.
